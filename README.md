# Project description ðŸ“œ
Android APP automation using **Appium &amp; Selenium**.
The main goal of this project was to check whether the app delivery *(Zee.Now)* services a specific zip code, in this case, zip codes of the City of SÃ£o Paulo. 
The idea came about when a lot of people had problems buying just because their zip codes weren't serviced, when I started to analyze I realized a lot of zip codes were within the area of delivery, but for some reason, they weren't being serviced. I came to the conclusion that zipcodes like the ones below aren't serviced because in the *Correios* database they're listed with other names, Even though the neighborhood is Rio Pequeno and are clearly serviced the ceps below aren't just because they're listed with different names. that's why I decided to build this script to test it.

Basically using a library called Appium and the Android Studio, I was able to install the app into a VDM to test and emulate the real process of putting each cep individually to test whether that zip code is serviced or not.

## Library ðŸ“š 

- Appium
- Selenium
- Pandas

Just running the requirements.txt file you can install all the required libraries/dependencies. 
Apart from the required libraries, you **must have the Android Studio** to emulate the app in a Virtual Device to test the app.

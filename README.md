The main goal of this project was to check whether the app delivery *(Zee.Now)* services a specific zip code, in this case, zip codes of the City of SÃ£o Paulo. 
The idea came about when a lot of people had problems buying just because their zip codes weren't serviced, when I started to analyze I realized a lot of zip codes were within the area of delivery, but for some reason, they weren't being serviced. that's why I decided to build this script to test each zip code individually to test whether that zip code is serviced or not. 

Basically using a library called Appium and the Android Studio, I was able to install the app into a VDM to test and emulate the real process of putting each cep.
I only tested using the zip codes of the City of SÃ£o Paulo, but you can test from other Brazilian cities where the delivery app operates such as Rio de Janeiro.

## Library ðŸ“š 

- Appium
- Selenium
- Pandas

Just running the requirements.txt file you can install all the required libraries/dependencies via **__pip install_**. 
Apart from the required libraries, you **must have the __Android Studio_** to emulate the app in a Virtual Device.

## Resources â˜• 
The following resources can be useful if you don't have familiarity with Automation.
I highly recommend reading the first resource, since the setup just to make the app run is highly complicated, tricky, and cumbersome it takes a lot of time to set up all the PATH variables to run.
